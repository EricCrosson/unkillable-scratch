;;; TODO

;; unkillable-scratch-really-kill
;;   actually kill the selected buffer at point. If this buffer was
;;   the last matching buffer to the regexp(s) keeping him from being
;;   killed, remove said regexp(s) from `unkillable-buffers'.

;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides a minor mode that will disallow buffers from
;; being killed. Any buffer matching a regexp in the list
;; `unkillable-buffers' will not be killed.

;; Only one bufer is in `unkillable-buffers' by default: the *scratch*
;; buffer.

;; The *scratch* buffer is considered specially; in the event of a
;; call to `kill-buffer' it will be regenerated (populated only with
;; `initial-scratch-message'.) Removing the regexp matching *scratch*
;; from `unkillable-buffers' disables this behavior.

;; Usage:

;; ; (optional): add regexp matching buffers to disallow killing to
;; ; list 'unkillable-scratch
;; (add-to-list 'unkillable-scratch "\\*.*\\*")

;; ; and activate the mode with
;; (unkillable-scratch 1)
;;   - or -
;; M-x unkillable-scratch

;; Conception thanks to
;; [[http://emacswiki.org/emacs/RecreateScratchBuffer][EmacsWiki:
;; Recreate Scratch Buffer]]

;; Idea to make the `unkillable-buffers' list thanks to
;; Donald Curtis (milkypostman)
